# React decoupled Front-end GUI

A demonstration Front-end GUI for a REST API, managing a simple set of CRUD operations. 

## Technologies used:
* React.js
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Operations:
GUI input sends request methods and data to the [API](https://github.com/bauerindustries/todos-rest-api) endpoints, to achieve the following:
* Read existing to-do items
* Create new to-do item/s
* Update existing to-do item/s
* Delete to-do item/s

## Hosting:
You can see this front-end running [here](https://stately-pixie-6617d4.netlify.app) on Netlify.

The API is running [here](https://todos-rest-api-demo.onrender.com/todos/).

The MongoDB database is hosted on MongoDB's Atlas Database.

## Requirements:
* The global variable window.TODO_API_URI must be the URL of the API

## The API:
For more details on the workings of the API, please see the repository [Readme](https://github.com/bauerindustries/todos-rest-api).

## Notes
This project was converted from the [Vue version](https://github.com/bauerindustries/vue-frontend-for-todo-api/) after completing Modules 1-4 on [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
